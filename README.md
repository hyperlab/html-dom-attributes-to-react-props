# HTML DOM Attributes to React Props
This package converts HTML DOM Attributes to React Props using the mapping between HTML attributes and React props used in the React DOM library.
This means changing the name from `font-size` to `fontSize`, and actually make boolean values true booleans for the attributes that support it.
It will let all unknown attributes pass without modification.
